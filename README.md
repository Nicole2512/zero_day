Second README
=======
Navigate to your home directory.
Create a directory zero_day. 
Navigate to this new directory. 
Initialize git and add the remote origin
Create a file README.md with Emacs (or other command line editors) and write a small Markdown text to present this project. This file is mandatory in projects
Add this new file to git, commit the change with this message “My first commit” and push to the remote server / origin (Note: You will probably need to set your login/password to push to the remote server)
Good job!

You pushed your first file in your first repository of the first task of your first School project.
